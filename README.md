# Richie Bot- Smart Routing:
============================

Richie Bot is a fictional bot servicing Richie Bank customers. It's developed as a chatbot powered by Google VertexAI. The visual interaction is done thorugh Voiceflow, a AI low-code platform to develop Chat & voice bots. This bot is completely friven by the Google VertexAI Chat-Bison-001 AI models with the help of Prompt Engineering.
Every single interaction is generated by CHAT-BISON-001 model based on the context and role set in the Prompt.

The steps involved in this Bot lifecycle:
=========================================

1. The Intent is identified through TEXT-BISON-001 model with the help of simple prompt design for the given user text utterance.
2. The Generated response from CHAT-BISON-001 is consumed via API and sent to the Voiceflow for prompting the user.
3. Fianlly, when the user needs to talk to Human agent or Intent itself is complex enough not to be served by Virtal agent or Richie bot in our case, then we need to transfer the user to Human agent. This step involves a complex routing strategy to be executed in the present contact center ecosystem. A routing strategy is selected and executed based on several paramters including sent from the Virtual agent or Richie Bot. Then the interaction is parked in a Queue based on the conditions matched. An agent belonging to that skill group and the Queue, based on agent availablity the interaction will be picked. Here the important thing to note is, the chat interaction between user and the virtual agent (Richie Bot) is not considered except for few key value pairs.
4. So, we are proposing to save this interaction, send it to TEXT-BISON-001 for summarising the interaction.
5. This chat summary is then injected in Prompt template for Queu identification, in Smart Routing step. Here the chat interaction sumamry an dother key value pairs are considered in identofying the best suited Queue. In this prompt design, we will be able to put some description about each Queue in simple human like natural language by business team or development team.

Once the Queue is identified the interaction is transferred to that queue from Voiceflow.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
=================

1. Java Springboot - middleware for Voiceflow to conect with Google VertexAI
2. Google VertexAI- CHAT-BISON-001, TEXT-BISON-001 models
3. Voiceflow - for chat flow development
4. Prompt Design/Engineering templates

   Here is the System Design:
